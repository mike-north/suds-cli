Adds comprehensive component builder exports for building rich CLI applications. The DSL package now exports 17 component builders covering common UI patterns: code viewer, file system navigation (filepicker, filetree), help systems (help, helpBubble), interactive lists, markdown rendering, pagination, animated progress bars with gradients, spinners, status bars, time tracking (stopwatch, timer), data tables, text input (textArea, textInput), and scrollable viewports. Each component builder provides a declarative API that integrates seamlessly with the App builder pattern.
