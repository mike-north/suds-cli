## Notes

- All components should be implemented in the `packages/` directory following the existing structure
- Each component should have its own package similar to existing packages (cursor, spinner, etc.)
- Testing patterns should match existing test patterns in the repository
- All code should pass the repository's linting and type checking requirements
- Consider the terminal compatibility and limitations when implementing each component
